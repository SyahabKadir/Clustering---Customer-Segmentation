In this project I will predicted the Customer Segmentation by differentiate the customer's behaviour by dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. The Model I used on this Machine Learning is **KMeans** with Silhoutte as an evaluation metric

This project caontains : **Business Understanding**, **Data Understanding**, **Data Cleaning**, **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Preprocessing** and **Modeling**
